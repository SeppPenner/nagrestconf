          <p><strong>03 February 2014 - SyNagios on ARM working.</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
              SyNagios for ARM devices is now working. It has been tested on the smaller
              Synology DS112 NAS device with 256MB of RAM and means that SyNagios should
              work on a large range of Synology devices.

          <p><strong>24 January 2014 - Web site goes live.</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
            The Nagrestconf web site is now available. Content is being added and it is far
            from complete but it's a start!

          <p><strong>16 January 2014 - SyNagios package released.</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
            Nagrestconf has been packaged up with Nagios and PNP4Nagios for Synology Diskstation
            storage devices. Both x86 and arm packages have been released but only the x86 pacakge
            has been tested so far. Setting up Nagios, PNP4Nagios and Nagrestconf on Synology is
            really simple, taking just a few clicks, and provides monitoring, graphing, and
            configuration in a single downloadable package.

          <p><strong>13 January 2014 - Nagrestconf goes from Alpha to Beta.</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
            After many years in alpha, Nagrestconf has finally moved to Beta. Most bugs have been
            fixed and no more features will be added to this version, although bug fixes and
            plugins may still be added.
